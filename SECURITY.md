# Security Policy

Please contact hello@gum.fun for any questions, issues, or concerns. We appreciate any and all feedback.

# 3rd party Security Audits
At the time of writing, we haven't undergone any 3rd party security audits.

# Bug Bounty Program
Due to financial constraints, we do not currently have a paid bug bounty program. We expect this to change in the future, although do not guarantee it, in which case retrospective grants will be considered on a case by case basis.
